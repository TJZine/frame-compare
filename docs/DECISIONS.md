# Decisions Log

- *2025-09-29:* Adopted CLI layout styling DSL with semantic spans and data-driven highlight rules. Renderer now consumes palette roles (`value`, `unit`, `path`, etc.), honors section accent theming, and evaluates JSON-configured thresholds (e.g., tonemap verification, boolean states) to keep formatting declarative.
- *2025-09-30:* Standardised group subhead styling across CLI sections: accent-subhead prefixes (`â€º`/`>` fallback), dim divider rules sized to block content, column alignment for numeric values, and verbose legends describing token roles to satisfy `features/CLI/GUIDE.md`.
- *2025-09-30:* Simplified diagnostics: removed measurement overlays for HDR tonemap output and trimmed frame-info overlays (no content-type line) to keep CLI banners uncluttered.
- *2025-10-01:* Persisted selection metadata sidecar v1 with deterministic cache keys, JSON-tail exposure, and generated.compframes annotations to satisfy CLI selection cache persistence guide.
